# Eco-Plastic-Solution
The Eco Plastic Revolution project aims to address the pervasive issue of plastic and stop it by innovating sustainable materials to achieve biodegradability and recyclability, aligning with environmental goals. Large retailers like Walmart, which rely heavily on plastic for their products, can benefit both environmentally and economically from this initiative.

# Problem Statement
Plastic has become ubiquitous due to its convenience, portability, and ease of use. However, its persistence in the environment has led to negative externalities, including pollution and ecosystem damage. To align with sustainability goals, Walmart aims to eliminate plastic from its operations by 2025. Achieving this goal requires the adoption of bioplastics, which, if properly designed and managed, can reduce these negative impacts.

# Proposed Solution:
Our solution involves the development of eco-friendly bioplastics derived from rice, wheat, and sugarcane residues. These agricultural by-products offer a sustainable source for plastic alternatives. Bioplastics have the potential to be both cost-effective and ecologically responsible for large retailers like Walmart. We will explore factors such as production costs, consumer demand, operational considerations, and sustainability goals to ensure the viability of this transition.

# Research Findings:
According to our research data, 51% of Walmart's product inventory is composed of plastic items. This presents a significant opportunity for the adoption of biodegradable and recyclable bioplastics. The production of wheat residue, with its high availability and smooth geolocational supply chain, further supports the feasibility of this initiative.

# Potential Collaborators:
Companies such as Bio-lution and Roseplastic, specializing in sustainable plastic solutions, could be valuable collaborators in promoting biodegradable infrastructure and contributing to the success of this project.
